## Natural Mortality

Natural mortality can take several alternative forms, including age-specific and or sex-specific. Further, natural mortality parameters, in common with growth parameters, can be time-varying or functions of environmental inputs. The most basic and simple form of natural mortality is:

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn4}
M_{\gamma, a} = \text{constant}
\end{equation}

where the natural mortality rate is constant across ages $a$ beginning at age 0 and equal for sexes $\gamma$.

## Initial Growth

Growth follows the von Bertalanffy function as re-formulated by **Schnute (1981)**, or by the Richards equation which has an option for a 3rd parameter to govern growth **(ADD REFERENCE)**. Growth is sex-specific. SS3 also allows for additional morphs with different growth patterns.

Mean size-at-age is calculated from growth parameters at the start of the initial year. The mean size-at-age of each morph is progressed forward according to the growth parameters active during that time period for subsequent seasons within that year and for subsequent years.

The sex-specific size-at-age in the initial population using the von Bertalanffy growth function is calculated as:

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn5}
L_{0,\gamma,a} = 
\begin{cases}
L_{\text{min bin}} + ba & \text{for $a \leq a_3$} \\
L_{\infty,\gamma} + (L_{1,\gamma} - L_{\infty,\gamma})e^{-k_{\gamma}(a-a_3)} & \text{for $a>a_3$ to $a=A-1$}\\
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

where $L_{\text{min bin}}$ is the lower limite of the first population bin, $b$ is the linear slope of growth for $a \leq a_3$ calculated as:

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn6}
b = \frac{L_{1,\gamma} - L_{\text{min bin}}}{a_3}
\end{equation}

$L_{0,\gamma, a}$ is the mean size at the start of the equilibrium year for animals of age $a$ and sex $\gamma$, $a_3$ (I) is a reference age near the youngest age well represented in the data, $L_{1,\gamma}$ (P) is the mean size
of sexs $\gamma$ at age $a_3$, $k_{\gamma}$ (P) is the growth coefficient for sex $\gamma$, and $L_{\infty,\gamma}$ is the mean asymptotic size, calculated from:

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn7}
L_{\infty,\gamma} = L_{1,\gamma} + \frac{L_{2,\gamma} - L_{1,\gamma}}{1 - e^{-k(a_4 - a_3)}}
\end{equation}

$a_4$ (I) is a reference age near the oldest age well represented in the data, and $L_{2,\gamma}$ (P) is the mean size of sex $\gamma$ at age $a_4$. An option allows $L_{2,\gamma}$ to be used directly as $L_{\infty,\gamma}$.

Growth within the plus-group in the initial year is accounted for by calculating an average length for the group by:

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn8}
L_{0,\gamma,A} = \frac{\sum_{a=A}^{2A}e^{-0.2(a-A)}(L_{0,\gamma}^{'}+(\frac{a-A}{A})(L_{\infty,\gamma} - L_{0,\gamma}^{'}))}{\sum_{a=A}^{2A}e^{-0.2(a-A)}} 
\end{equation}

where $L_{0,\gamma}^{'}$ is defined as the size at the plus-group age defined from the growth curve (Eqn. \ref{eqn5}) which is used to calculate the potential growth in the plus-group beyond the maximum age set within the model.

Equation \ref{eqn8} would logically use natural mortality as the decay factor. However, growth is calculated before natural mortality (to allow for size-specific natural mortality), so a fixed decay constant of 0.2 is used. Also, A should be large enough such that growth within the plus-group is small.

## Growth

The mean size-at-age for the von Bertalanffy growth curve by sex at the start of each season for each growth morph is incremented across years as:

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn9}
L_{y+1,\gamma,a} = L_{y,\gamma,a} + (L_{y,\gamma,a-k} - L_{\infty,\gamma}) (e^{-k_{\gamma}} - 1) \;\ \text{for $a<A$}
\end{equation}

where $k_{\gamma}$ (P) is the growth coeffient for sex $\gamma$.

The mean size at the start of the season for the plus-group is calculated based on a weighted average of fish moving into the plus-group and existing plus-group fish. This approach allows for a decline in the mean size of fish in the plus-group over time as fishing mortality reduces the numbers in the plus-group. It also prevents an instantaneous change in size of plus-group fish when growth parameters are allowed to be time-varying.

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn10}
L_{y,t+1,\gamma,a} = \frac{N_{y,t,\gamma,A-1} \tilde{L}_{y,t,\gamma,A} (L_{y,t,\gamma,A} + (L_{y,t,\gamma,A} - L_{\infty,\gamma}) (e^{-k_{\gamma}} - 1))}{ N_{y,t,A-1} + N_{y,t,\gamma,A} } 
\end{equation}

DEFINE $t$. IS IT THE START OF A SEASON SINCE BELOW SEASON DURATION IS $\delta_s$?

Note that size in the plus-group from Equation \ref{eqn10} will differ slightly from size in the plus-group in the initial year from Equation \ref{eqn8} if fish are still growing appreciably when they reach age $A$ and if the mortality factor of 0.2, in Equation \ref{eqn8} is not close to the mortality rate in the appliation. 

Fish of each sex grow according to their current size and current yearâ€™s $k$ and $L_{\infty}$. This cohort-specific growth propagates into forecasts. Fish are not allowed to shrink if $L_{\infty}$ declines. Provision exists for cohort-specific $k$ deviations in addition to time-varying $k$, $L_{\infty}$, and $L_1$. Another option allows for age-specific $k$ for a user-specified number of younger ages.

The mean size in the middle of the season is calculated from the size at the start of the season as:

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn11}
\tilde{L}_{y,t,\gamma,a} = L{y,t,\gamma,a} + (L_{y,t,\gamma,a} - L_{\infty,\gamma})(e^{-0.5\delta_{s}k_{\gamma}} - 1)
\end{equation}

where $\delta_s$ (I) is the duration of the season.

## Variation in Size-at-Age

Variation in size can be a function of age or mean length-at-age, with the option of either having the parameters for each sex expressed in terms of the coefficient of variation or the standard deviation. For example, the standard deviation of length-at-age for each sex $\gamma$ when the coefficient of variation in length changes linearly with size-at-age between parameters specified for ages $a_3$ and $a_4$ for each sex $\gamma$ is given by:

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn12}
\sigma_{\gamma, a} = 
\begin{cases}
\tilde{L}_{\gamma,a}CV_{1,\gamma} \;\ \text{for $a \leq a_3$} \\
\tilde{L}_{\gamma,a}\biggl(CV_{1,\gamma} + \frac{\tilde{L}_{\gamma,a} - L_{1,\gamma}}{L_{2,\gamma} - L_{1,\gamma}}(CV_{2,\gamma} - CV_{1,\gamma})\biggr) \;\ \text{for $a_3 < a < a_4$}\\
\tilde{L}_{\gamma,a}CV_{2,\gamma} \;\ \text{for $a \geq a_4$} \\
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

where $CV_{1,\gamma}$ (P) is the coefficient of variation for length for sex $\gamma$ at age $a_3$ , and $CV_{2,\gamma}$ (P) is the coefficient of variation for length for sex $\gamma$ at age $a_4$.
